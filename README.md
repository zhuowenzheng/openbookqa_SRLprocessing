# openbookqa_SRLprocessing

This is a python script used for the preprocessing of `OpenbookQA` Dataset, which adds `PropBank` Semantic Role Labeling(SRL) annotations to the dataset.  

To run preprocessing using the SRL model derived from `get_predictor()`, you may need to:  
`pip install allennlp-models`  
to solve the `srl_bert` incompatible problem.
